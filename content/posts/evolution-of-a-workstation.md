Throughout my life I've used a lot of different computers and operating
systems.  in 1988 I started with a commodore 64 machine.  My friend had a c64
also -- his had a cassette tape drive for saving and loading data -- no hard
drive, no floppy.  Mine was a bit newer (and my dad was a bit more interested
in computers) so we had a 1541 5Â¼" floppy drive -- AND a "fastload" cartridge
(look it up)  

In the early 90's in school I used Apple IIe to play oregon trail and to write
"code" that will move a little triangle around on the screen and draw lines.  

Later we had windows on an intel 286... 386... 486... pentium.. and pentium pro
machines at home -- all built by hand by me and/or my dad from parts we would
buy at a local computer parts store, or a hamvention, or some kind of
electronics flea-market / swap meet type of setting.  It was a very exciting
and dynamic time for computers!  Everything was faster every time you checked.
Modems went from 300 baud to 1200 to 2400 to 9600 to 14400 to 28800 -- all in
the span of a few years.

I continued using windows into the new millennium -- even though I grew
increasingly more frustrated with it.  I tried running a few linux
distributions over the years with limited success -- Hardware support was ok
but software was scarce.

Finally in 2006 I read that Apple was beginning to ship computers with intel
processors which would more easily allow software to be ported from windows to
run on OS X.  Also there were a few mature virtualization projects like
parallels that promised if you switched to mac you wouldn't be completely out
of luck if you really needed to run a windows app.  So I went for it.

It was challenging at first, but quickly I fell in love with OS X.  It was such 
a better experience than Windows provided. It was fundamentally different in a
few key ways and at some point I opened the terminal and realized "Hey, this
is a lot like linux!"

I view OSX as a well polished linux distribution -- it's not really, but it's
close enough.  I used OS X for over a decade.  After Steve Jobs passed I noticed
apple's innovation really started to slow down.  I felt the hardware was overpriced
and I didn't like feeling "locked in" to buying it.  I actually went and gave windows
another try, but quickly remembered why I left in the first place (it's even worse
now).  So I decided to give Linux another try.

This is basically like that moment in "2001 a space odyssey" where the hominids
discover the Monolith and everything changes.  One new discovery lead to another
and another and eventually lead me here.

Now you know the backstory, stay tuned for my next post about what came next.
