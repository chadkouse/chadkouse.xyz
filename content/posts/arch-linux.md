Sometimes I have to screenshare for work with other developers, and pretty often
they want to know something about my environment.

The answer to that one is, at least for the last year or so, Arch Linux.

I tried a lot of different distros -- Ubuntu, Centos, ElementaryOS, Linux Mint,
popOS, even gentoo.  I ultimately settled on Arch because I like the minimalism
combined with the rolling release model -- plus of course sometimes you just
wanna go flex (kidding.. kind of)

As I mentioned, I use dwm for my window manager -- so the distro really doesn't
matter that much.  A lot of distros are debian / ubuntu based and what
differentiates them from each other are the preconfigured desktop environments
and the package managers.  The arch package manager works fine for me so I'm 
good to go there.  Plus part of my philosophy is to strip away the layers of
shiny UI and hand-holding so I can get a better understanding of what's really
going on under the hood.  Arch gives me that.  Arch also has great documentation
for when things are unclear.  I highly recommend it.

If the install process is too daunting for you, I would recommend 
[Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/) which is basically Arch with a user
friendly installer and no systemd, if that's something you're in to.
