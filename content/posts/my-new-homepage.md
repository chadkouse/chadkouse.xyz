I've decided to put this website up as a way to claim my online identity
without the... less-than-positive feelings that come with social media these
days. I want to keep it lightweight and minimal - which has become a theme to a
lot of aspects of my life. I hope to illustrate some of those here in future
posts, and show how stripping back the shiny layers in life that sometimes can
seem welcoming can lead you to better understanding of what's underneath.
